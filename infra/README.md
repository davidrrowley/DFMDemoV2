Infrastructure as code lives here. Use the folder structure that matches your chosen tooling.

## Suggested layout
- bicep/: Azure Bicep templates
- terraform/: Terraform modules and environments
- scripts/: helper scripts for deployment

## Local dependencies
See infra/local/docker-compose.yml for a minimal local stack.
