# Accessibility baseline

## Minimum expectations
- Keyboard navigation for all interactive UI.
- Visible focus outlines.
- Semantic HTML.
- ARIA only when needed, and correctly applied.
- Form fields have labels and meaningful errors.

## Testing
- Run Lighthouse accessibility checks.
- Manual keyboard-only pass for primary journeys.
- Screen reader spot checks for critical flows.
