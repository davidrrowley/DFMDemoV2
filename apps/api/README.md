# API App (Backend)

This is the backend application workspace. Add services under apps/api/src.

## Contracts
- OpenAPI spec lives in apps/api/openapi.yaml.
- Versioning guidance is in docs/api/versioning.md.

## Getting started
- Add a README section for your runtime (Node, Python, .NET, etc.).
- Add run scripts and tests once the service is created.
