# Web App (IBM Carbon)

This is the front-end workspace, intended for IBM Carbon-based web UI.
For Windows and Android defaults, see `docs/standards/ui-platform-standards.md`.

## Structure
- carbon/: theme and design token overrides
- public/: static assets
- src/: application code

## Getting started
- Add your framework and runtime instructions here (React, Next.js, etc.).
- Ensure components follow IBM Carbon guidance.
