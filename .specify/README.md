# Spec-kit support (.specify)

This folder contains spec-driven workflow assets compatible with spec-kit style projects.

Contents:
- `templates/` for constitution, spec, plan, tasks and checklists
- `memory/` shared context for tools and agents
- `scripts/powershell/` helpers for Windows-first workflows

Template note:
- Files use placeholders like `[PROJECT_NAME]` and `[FEATURE NAME]`.
- Project-specific specs live in `specs/` (created per-feature). Project documentation lives in `docs/`.
