# Skill: adr-writing

    ## Intent
    Turn a decision candidate into an ADR with context, options, decision, and consequences.

    ## Inputs
    - Decision candidate
- Links to relevant requirements
- Architecture notes

    ## Outputs
    - ADR markdown file content
- Index update notes

    ## Process
    1. Capture context and drivers.
2. List options considered.
3. Record decision.
4. Consequences + follow-ups.
5. Status and supersedence rules.

    ## Quality bar
    - No invented rationale.
- Options are plausible and fairly represented.

    ## Escalation triggers
    - Missing rationale
- Decision not actually decided
- Needs deeper analysis (handoff to architecture skill)

    ## Tooling notes
    Follow the calling agent's tool allow/deny list.
