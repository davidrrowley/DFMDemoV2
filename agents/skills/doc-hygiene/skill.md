# Skill: doc-hygiene

    ## Intent
    Keep docs consistent: headings, links, structure, ADR/index updates.

    ## Inputs
    - changed docs
- standards

    ## Outputs
    - updated docs and indices
- broken link list (if any)

    ## Process
    1. Check formatting and consistency.
2. Ensure links resolve.
3. Update indexes.
4. Ensure new terms are defined.
5. Run markdown lint guidance.

    ## Quality bar
    No broken structure; docs are easy to scan.

    ## Escalation triggers
    Large doc churn; unclear ownership.
