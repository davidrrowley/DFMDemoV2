# Citations and evidence

Prefer:
1. Primary sources (official documentation, vendor docs, standards)
2. In-repo artefacts (`specs/`, `docs/`, ADRs)
3. High-signal community sources (only when primary sources are unavailable)

When evidence can change over time (policies, pricing, limits), record versions and effective dates.
