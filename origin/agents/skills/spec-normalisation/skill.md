# Skill: spec-normalisation

    ## Intent
    Turn rough notes into a coherent `specs/**/spec.md` with testable acceptance criteria.

    ## Inputs
    - notes, emails, tickets
- constraints
- existing spec (if any)

    ## Outputs
    - updated spec sections
- explicit assumptions and questions

    ## Process
    1. Extract goals, users, journeys.
2. Convert requirements into testable statements.
3. Add acceptance criteria.
4. List open questions.
5. Check for contradictions.

    ## Quality bar
    Spec is coherent, testable, and complete enough to plan.

    ## Escalation triggers
    Contradictory stakeholder inputs; missing critical constraints.
