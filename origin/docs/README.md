# Docs

Standards, architecture notes, ADRs, and runbooks live here.

Note: this `origin/` content is a baseline snapshot for scaffold/refresh scripts. Edit root docs for live guidance.

Use this folder to keep governance and operations discoverable:

- ADRs: record material decisions in `docs/adr/` and update `docs/adr/index.md`.
- Architecture: update `docs/architecture/architecture.md` when system structure changes.
- Runbooks: add operational procedures under `docs/runbooks/` for repeatable incidents.
- Standards: update `docs/standards/` when adding or changing engineering rules.
- UI platform standards: see `docs/standards/ui-platform-standards.md` for web, Windows, and Android defaults.
