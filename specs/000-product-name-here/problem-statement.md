## Product Problem Statement

### Context

[Describe the environment your users operate in, and why the problem exists now. Keep this grounded in observable reality.]

Examples of prompts:
- What information overload, workflow fragmentation, or organisational friction exists today?
- What moments cause ideas or evidence to be lost?
- What is changing (volume, speed, regulation, complexity, device sprawl)?

### Target Users

- Primary user persona(s): [e.g. Knowledge worker, Engineer, Consultant, Researcher]
- Secondary users: [optional]
- Environment: [desktop/mobile/offline/regulated/etc.]

### Core Problem

People lack a frictionless way to capture and reuse meaningful information, including:
1. The **artefact** (e.g. photo, screenshot, voice note, excerpt, file, link).
2. The **context** (why it mattered, where it came from, what it relates to).

### Impact

Without a better system, users experience:
- Loss of valuable ideas or evidence
- Repeated effort and reinvention
- Overwhelm due to unmanaged accumulation
- Difficulty moving from consumption to creation / decision

Quantify if possible:
- [time wasted per week]
- [missed opportunities]
- [quality risk / compliance risk]

### Problem Definition

There is currently no lightweight, cross-platform system that:
- enables ultra-fast capture in real-world and digital contexts,
- stores both artefacts and contextual metadata,
- supports organisation without heavy manual effort,
- enables rediscovery through search and exploration,
- supports reuse and creation of outputs from accumulated knowledge.

### Desired Outcome (What Success Looks Like)

A user should be able to:
- Capture something meaningful in seconds, anywhere.
- Trust it will be available later when relevant.
- Rediscover insights through search or exploration.
- See relationships between items (optionally visually).
- Assemble outputs from accumulated knowledge rather than starting from zero.

### Scope Boundaries

In scope:
- [list what the system will do]

Out of scope (for now):
- [list what the system will not do yet]

### Key Constraints

- Capture must be low friction.
- Organisation must not require complex taxonomy maintenance.
- The system must remain useful as the dataset grows over time.
- Privacy and ownership of user data must be preserved.

### One-Sentence Summary

[Write one sentence that defines the problem and the desired outcome.]
